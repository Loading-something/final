<h2  style="text-align: center;">This is basically a short biography of my life playing soccer</h2>
<p>I'll start off by when I first played soccer. 
This was before I moved to Nebraska and was living in California. 
I was on this little kid team with my two older brothers and my dad as a coach. 
I can't remember the name of our team but there is only one play of the game that wont leave my memory even if I tried. 
I was playing as the right wing as a mid-fielder. 
The play just started and I was running at the same pace as my teammates so if needed they can pass to me. 
But they didn't even need to, I watched as three of my teammates just effortlessly passed through the defenders together. 
They stayed in a triangle formation which allowed them to pass to each of them while running past and through the defenders. 
Within 10 to 20 seconds since the play started they were already in the goal box. 
Right as the person in front got the pass the goalie rushed and slide towards him to block the goal. 
Right as he was about to shoot, he stopped the ball and hit it with his heel! 
Passing it to the teammate behind him, and he shot from outside of the goal box straight into the goal. 
That was the first time I was in awe from soccer. 
Since then I've been obsessed with soccer until fressman year of highschool. 
Fast forward to 7th grade, this would be my second year playing soccer in Nebraska.
I was positioned as a all rounder, I could play any position except goalie since we already had one. 
But as time went on, not just me but the coaches noticed my stamina was getting worse. 
Which made since we knew I had asthma but I had my inhaler so no one was worried too much.
But one practice we were warming up by jogging around the field. 
As we were jogging we came up to a small incline and at this point I was already almost out of gas but once I got up it and finished the jog. 
It felt like my heart was about to burst and my chest was trying to "cave" in on itself. 
This was the time where the coaches and my parents gave me a choice to either quit for my own health or play only goalie. 
The last thing I wanted to do was quit so I accepted being goalie. 
While I didn't like it at first, I started to like it more than playing any other position. 
Not to toot my own horn but I was a great goalie, for that season alone I got scored on a total of 3 times. 
Now it wasn't only because I was a good goalie but I had really good teammates. 
Some games I wouldn't even touch the ball, which sucked a lot.
One year later I was forced to doing track and field; which if you did not know requires a ton of running. 
After one practice I was rushed to the ER because I looked like I was dying. 
My lips were a slight shade of blue or was turning blue, it didn't feel like I was fully there just mainly responding to what people were telling me to do. 
When we got there I felt better I could breathe almost normally but the pain from my chest was still there. 
They ran some tests and found out that maybe it was due to my heart instead of it being only asthma. 
So my mom took me 5-6 hours away to a child heart specialist and that was when we found out that I had a problem with my heart. 
I was diagnosed with an "accelerated irregular heart beat". 
Which means that just by dead sprinting about 10 yards my heart beat is already up to 150bpm on a good day. 
The irregular part I don't fully understand why it was bad but I think it increases the chance of me having a heart attack. 
Or it just increases the pain since its not regularly beating but instead missing some of those beats. 
This didn't really affect me until I started watching some videos about people playing sports with a similar condition. 
Watching the players just randomly fall and lay there during games. 
Then I watched a documentary in class and it was about this girl that was just casually walking down a hallway and then fell straight to the floor. 
It was then said she had a heart attack and that was when it felt like my world was crashing down on me. 
I was scared that I would just die randomly. 
For a year or two since I would be scared to do anything that would cause my heart to beat fast. 
That meant no more playing soccer; however, I didn't stop loving the sport. 
I would watch the world cup for soccer for the next year and thats when I started to just play with the ball. 
Whenever I could I would practice some techniques and learn how to do more flashy tricks. 
And the joy I felt playing soccer came back and ever since I've just been doing more and learning more tricks. </p>
